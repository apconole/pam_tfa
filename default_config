## Example Two-factor PAM Configuration

# The following is a sample email address. My recommendation is to use an SMTP 
# to SMS gateway. For verizon, this happens to be cell-number@vtext.com
# UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES make this an email address that is only readable after
# logging in (duh!)
email    = myAuthPlace@foo.com

# Set this to your source address.
from     = myAuthPlace@foo.com

# Set this to your server.
server   = mail.foo.com

# This is either going to be 25, 485, and 587
port     = 587

# username (obvious)
username = myUsername

# password (again, duh)
password = myPassword

# The 'fail to send' policy. Currently, this isn't implemented.
fail     = deny
